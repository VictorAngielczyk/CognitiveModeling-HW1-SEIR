In this exercise, you will make some improvements to the raw mini-project provided in seir.zip on
LMS. Note that you cannot create a Git repository inside another Git repository, so you need to
submit this separately. In particular, you would:
1. Add an appropriate .gitignore file.
2. Ensure there are no hard-coded values within the functions; instead, provide function argu-
ments with meaningful defaults.
3. Add numpy as a dependency and use numpy arrays instead of Python lists in the simulator.
4. Add a proper environment.yml / pyproject.toml file specifying all dependencies.
5. Add proper type hints using the typing module.
6. Use the init .py files to expose all functionality in the submodule Python files directly.
7. Use atomic commits and ensure your staging area is empty at the end of the exercis
